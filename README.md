## Why Too Much Homework is bad

- Waste time
- Inefficiency
- Affects sleep quality
- Affects mental health

## Thinking this is violation of ethics?

If you think so, please do not use it.

Homework is designed to help students to understand the knowledge,
not used to control students.

I personally use Khan Academy and Wikipedia to learn things,
that's time-saving and efficiency.

But schools may ask me to submission the homework...
This platform is just a workaround for this.

### How to Escape

- Use Khan Academy, Wikipedia or other self-learning resources
- Leave school at 6:30
